Prerequisites
-------------

You will require a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) with integrated Bluetooth Low Energy radio (Pi version 3 and greater).  See our [Make a Raspberry Pi Hub](https://reelyactive.github.io/make-a-pi-hub.html) tutorial for detailed step-by-step instructions.


Installation
------------

Clone the repo.

    npm install

(This step is fully documented in the [tutorial](https://reelyactive.github.io/make-a-pi-hub.html))


Operation
---------

Run the program from the root of the repository:

    sudo node pi-suite

(This step is also fully documented in the [tutorial](https://reelyactive.github.io/make-a-pi-hub.html))


How do I know it's working?
---------------------------

The Pi will serve up a webpage which can be accessed locally via http://localhost or over the network via http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx where the x values would be replaced by the Pi's IP address.
